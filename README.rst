===============================
Linux kernel keyutils binddings
===============================

Linux kernel provides a secure storage for sensitive data. This package provides a way to set, retrieve
and invalidate key-value pairs in the kernel keyring in session scope.

Package is in early stage of development, and using keyrings other than session storage is currently
unsupported.

####
Why?
####

Existing `keyring https://pypi.org/project/keyring/` package is very powerful, but somewhat complex
and heavy.

`keyctl https://pypi.org/project/keyctl/` uses subprocess instead of system call, which introduces
possible points of failure and requires keyctl utility.

This package uses rust and PyO3 to make system calls directly to the kernel.

############
Usage
############

```python
import python_linux_keyutils

python_linux_keyutils.set_session_secret("secret_name","secret_value")
python_linux_keyutils.get_session_secret("secret_name")
python_linux_keyutils.invalidate_session_secret("secret_name")
```
